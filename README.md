# Handwritten Digits Classifier using Deep Learning
 
This repository contains a Handwritten Digits Classifier Project that use different deep learning architectures as convolutional neuronal networks to classify a given image of a handwritten digit from MNIST dataset

The notebook is available at https://github.com/dianamartinr/HandwrittenDigitsClassifierProject/blob/main/MNIST-DeepNN.ipynb
